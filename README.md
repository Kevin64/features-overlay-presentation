FOP is a program designed to present to the user some tutorial or step-by-step instructions of any subject, in order to educate and teach the workforce about any procedure. The software allows to be executed after user logon if desired, enforcing them to watch all steps and enabling a timer between each step. Afterwards, the user can watch again, but this time without the timer restraints.

For IT admins: FOP allows to register in [APCS](https://github.com/Kevin64/asset-and-personnel-control-system) the service delivery made, triggering an logon execution.
